Some examples of projects created in Java during my traineeship software engineering at Sogyo.

- In Fibonacci, a number is requested and the program will print the Fibonacci term with that index.
  It also calculates the sum of all even valued terms.
  
- In Guessing Game the user gets 10 chances to guesses a number and the computer responds to each guess 
  by answering “Higher”, “Lower” or “Correct”.

- Robot is a simple robot that moves through a factory based on simple commands like “turn left”,
 “turn right”, “forward”, “backward”. It moves in a grid and each turn is 90 degrees.
